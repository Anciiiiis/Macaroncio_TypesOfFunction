# Macaroncio_TypesOfFunction
For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you should be able to interact with it for your walk-through video. From your chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

You will upload your solution to GitHub and share a code walk-through as explained below.

Four Project Requirements
There are four requirements for the project which we will explain in detail in the video:

You will submit your project on GitHub, so you will need an account and know how to share a public repository
You will include a README.md file in your project's GitHub repository (root folder). The README should provide a concise and clear overview of your project's purpose and functionality. This will help other developers understand the motivation behind your project and how to use it.
To assist you in creating your README, we have provided a starter template you can use.
This is an example of a README. Note that yours does not need to be this detailed. This is simply a reference.
You will record a video of 5 mins or less reviewing the three contracts you choose - Loom is a great tool to use if needed.
In the video, you will do a code walk-through where you share your screen and explain the code. In the video, explain the code and what it is doing.
Note: we will accept just audio with a screenshare, but, we highly recommend doing the video and screenshare since it will better prepare you for job interviews.
For some assessments/projects, you will need to share a transaction ID. (This project is NOT one of them.)
